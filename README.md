# Learning a Deep Color Difference Metric for Photographic Images

## Introduction
This repository contains the official pytorch implementation of the paper ["Learning a Deep Color Difference Metric for Photographic Images"](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=XMf6ilrxXo) by Zhihua Wang, Haoyu Chen, Yang Yang, Qilin Sun, and Kede Ma, IEEE Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition, 2023.

Most well-established and widely used color difference (CD) metrics are handcrafted and subject-calibrated against uniformly colored patches, which do not generalize well to photographic images characterized by natural scene complexities. Developing CD formulae for photographic images is still an active research topic in imaging/illumination, vision science, and color science communities. In this paper,we aim to learn a deep CD metric for photographic images.
